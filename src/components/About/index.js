              Often there arise some thoughts in the human mind that tend to
              impact our day to day lives negatively. Poorly-managed negative
              thoughts are not good for mental as well as physical health.
              Negative attitudes and feelings of helplessness can create chronic
              stress, which upsets the body's hormone balance depleting the
              brain chemicals required for happiness. It is rightly said that
              "Misery loves Company" but in many cases, people are not
              comfortable in sharing their miseries with known ones.
